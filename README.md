# VCL-USSD-CLONE
This is not a full function USSD, only the buying of daily voice bundles is functional and the airtime advance option.
The rest of the functions in one way or the other behave like the two implemented here.
For the M-Pesa part I will be cloning the Ecocash USSD which has the same functionality as the M-Pesa.
